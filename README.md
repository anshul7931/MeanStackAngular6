#Custom

First step: npm install -g @angular/cli

ng new <project_name> 

For material design we can also use "ng add @angular/material"

Now open the <project_name> folder in vs code(code .)

To run the project, simply use "ng serve -o"

We can generate our own components from CLI using "ng genereate component components/<component_name>" or "ng g c components/<name>"
(It will update app.module.ts and will create html,scss,.ts and spec files)

Main/Index component is app.component.html

We can embed one component into another using the selector defined in <name>.component.ts file


Now after editing style.scss, component's css, we can provide the routes in app-routing.module.ts by importing our components and editing Routes = [];


Now we want to fetch a list of users from public API, for that we will create a service by using Angular cli 
"ng generate service <service_name>". This will create test file and a service file(.spec.ts and .ts resp).
If we have a reusable code to be accessed between multiple components, then we can create service for it.When it comes to fetch result from public API/accessing the DB etc then we create a service file.
If we fant to fetch the result from a API, then we can use, angular6 internal http client.


After adding the service, we need to add http client module in app.module.ts
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

Services cant be used all alone, they can be used by a component, so inside one component.ts file we will import the service and Observable(to hold data) . Now we need to call the service.
We can import ActivatedRoute for urls like /id

After the service call we will change the html of the component.

For adding animations we use npm i @angular/animations@latest --save
Now import in app module.

For deployment , run ng build (dist folder will be created)
For production deployment, run ng build --prod


In dist folder, open index.html and change <base href="/"> to: <base href="./">
